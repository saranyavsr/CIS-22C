Please compile Maze.java
Running the executable Maze with an argument like maze.txt(provided if the file is available in the same folder as the executable), the program will try to process the text file and generate a maze out of it. Finally, a graphical representation(using swing and awt) of the maze and the path will be shown.

If just run the executable without an argument, it will ask you for a n value. Maze will be generated from this n value and a graphical representation as above will be shown.

Note: the format for the input file should be .txt, the first value should be 'n' value. Each door should be represented in a single line in the format ( North South East West):
